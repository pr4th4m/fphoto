### Check working app [here](http://fphoto.herokuapp.com/)

#### Supported Browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Mozilla Firefox

#### NOTE:
- Directories "django_facebook", "open_facebook" and "unidecode" and third party libraries.
- While working, I found a bug in "django_facebook" project which I have reported [here](https://github.com/tschellenbach/Django-facebook/issues/440).
- I have fixed the bug, but it would not be merged soon. That's the reason to include the entire library(bug fixed version) in currect project.

#### Deployment:
- The project is been deployed on Heroku.
- I was facing few problems deploying to Google App Engine.
- Seems, Google App Engine does't like few modules.

#### WARNING:
- I have un-register the app from facebook and heroku, please confirm back after your review process.
